Requirements
These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If there are details I have omitted, it is because I will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don't worry about finding "the" solution.
1. Create a browser or native-app-based application to serve as a basic weather app.
2. Search Screen
    * Allow customers to enter a US city
    * Call the openweathermap.org API and display the information you think a user would be interested in seeing. Be sure to has the app download and display a weather icon.
    * Have image cache if needed
3. Auto-load the last city searched upon app launch.
4. Ask the User for location access, If the User gives permission to access the location, then retrieve weather data by default
